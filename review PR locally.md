Fetch the PR: Get the PR's changes from the remote repository.

git fetch origin pull/ID/head:pr-test-branch

Checkout the PR: After fetching, switch to the new branch.

git checkout pr-test-branch

Test Locally: Now, you can review and test the PR changes on your local machine.

Switch back to your main branch (usually main or master):

git checkout main







Create a New Branch for Testing

If you don't want to touch your main branch, you can create a separate branch for testing the PR:

    Create a new branch:

git checkout -b test-pr-branch

Merge the PR into the test branch (if you want to test the changes in the context of your latest branch):

git merge origin/pull/ID/head


Test the code on the new test branch.

Once done, you can delete the test branch without affecting anything else:

git branch -d test-pr-branch
